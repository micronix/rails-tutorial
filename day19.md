Today we will develop a workout log app, today I won't tell you the columns but only describe what the app should do and you have to figure out what the columns should be.

The app should keep track of when you did the workout, what type of work out it was and how many minutes you worked out for.

We then need to create an app that does the following:

- add workout log entries
- edit workout log entries
- search log by date
