# Rails Tutorial - Week 1

### Goal:

Create a rails app and deploy it to the web. Access it from your phone and
share it with friends and family.

### Goals of the course

- Give you confidence to learn on your own
- Learn how web technologies work
- Learn how to create web applications
- How to debug & troubleshoot problems

### Recommended Courses

There is not enough time to learn everything there is to know in the
short amount of time we have. In order to be a successful programmer
you need to know certain tools to such a level that they become automatic.

The create of the rails tutorial has created more courses in different skills
and we recommend that you work through them if you have the time.
We recommend **Learn Enough Command Line** and **Learn Enough HTML** to get
most from this course.

### How to read the book

- Find a quite comfortable place
- Turn off all distractions
- Have pen and paper next to you
- Read each paragraph slowly (it helps me to read outloud sometimes)
- Write down anything that doesn't fully make sense
- Don't copy and paste code, write it out yourself (you won't be copying and pasting code as a developer)
- Make small changes to experiment with what he did

### How to use class

Our class time will be used to answer questions about the tutorial, and go over material not convered in the tutorial. Bring the notes you made while reading the book to class and review any questions or confusing aspects before class.

### Class Agenda

- (30 mins) Questions Section
- (30 mins) Supplemental material
- (30 mins) In class exercises
- (30 mins) Buffer if we run out of time.

Ask specific questions you had while reading the tutorial. If you don't have questions remember the parts that were confusing and ask to go over those parts in class again. Sometimes things don't make sense, but it's difficult to formulate a question.
