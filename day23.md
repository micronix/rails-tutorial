### Reviews feature

Today we will be adding a review feature to our products app. Our review will have a dropdown for the number of stars (1-5) that a user gives the book.
The user will also enter their username and some text explaining why they like the product.

We will then display the reviews with the username and the number of stars for each review when the product is clicked. When listing all the products,
we will list the average rating.

Here we will introduce the use of fontawesome icons.
